// README for Model Files
//
// This directory contains TensorFlow Lite model files for the autism screening application.
// In a production environment, these would be trained models for:
// 1. Autism screening analysis (autism_screening_model.tflite)
// 2. Report generation (report_generation_model.tflite)
// 3. Intervention planning (intervention_planning_model.tflite)
// 4. Conversational AI (conversational_model.tflite)
//
// For development and testing, these are placeholder files.
// Real models would need to be trained on appropriate datasets and converted to TFLite format.
//
// Model Requirements:
// - Input: Processed video features, child metadata, temporal sequences
// - Output: ASD probability, confidence scores, behavioral observations
// - Architecture: CNN + LSTM for temporal analysis, attention mechanisms for key features
