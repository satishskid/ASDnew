# NeuroKinetics AI Platform

## Clinical-Grade Mobile/Tablet Autism Screening & Intervention Platform

NeuroKinetics AI is a comprehensive mobile and tablet application that leverages camera-based morphokinetic observations and local AI models to detect, diagnose, and provide personalized interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related behavioral disorders.

### 🎯 Mission

To democratize early autism detection and intervention by providing clinical-grade screening tools that are accessible, affordable, and effective for families and healthcare providers worldwide.

### 🔬 Scientific Foundation

#### Evidence-Based Approach
- **Morphokinetic Biomarkers**: Eye gaze patterns, facial expressions, head movements, body gestures, social response timing, repetitive behaviors, and joint attention deficits
- **Clinical Validation**: Designed to achieve 87.8% sensitivity and 80.8% specificity using tablet-based camera systems
- **Gold Standard Compliance**: Structured for comparison against ADOS and ADI-R diagnostic standards

### 🏗️ System Architecture

#### On-Device AI Processing
- **TensorFlow Lite Integration**: Local AI models for privacy, real-time processing, and offline functionality
- **MediaPipe Integration**: Advanced pose estimation and facial analysis
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Encrypted local processing with minimal data transmission

#### Three-Stage Clinical Pipeline

## 📋 Stage 1: Gamified Screening Module (6-10 Minutes)

### Interactive Assessment Tasks
- **Social Engagement Games**: Bubble popping, animated character interactions, peek-a-boo sequences
- **Visual Stimulus Presentation**: Social vs non-social scenes, biological vs scrambled motion, emotional faces
- **Motor Activity Assessment**: Imitation tasks, fine motor games, repetitive behavior observation

### Camera-Based Data Capture
- **Eye Tracking Metrics**: Fixation duration, saccadic patterns, pupil dilation, blink rate, visual scanning paths
- **Facial Expression Analysis**: Micro-expressions, smile frequency, social cue responses
- **Head and Body Movement**: Head orientation, postural stability, stereotypic movements, response latency

## 📊 Stage 2: AI-Powered Diagnostic Analysis

### Multi-Modal Feature Extraction
- **Behavioral Pattern Recognition**: Social communication deficits, restricted/repetitive behaviors
- **Developmental Comparison**: Age-appropriate norm benchmarking and trajectory tracking
- **Clinical Scoring Algorithm**: 0-100 ASD probability index with DSM-5 criteria mapping

## 📋 Stage 3: Comprehensive Report Generation

### Clinical Report Components
- **Executive Summary**: ASD likelihood, severity classification, key behavioral observations
- **Detailed Assessment Results**: Domain-by-domain analysis with visual graphs and video annotations
- **Parent-Friendly Explanation**: Accessible language, analogies, visual aids, and educational resources

## 🎯 Stage 4: Personalized Intervention Copilot

### AI-Powered Intervention Planning
- **Individualized Treatment Plans**: SMART goals, priority intervention areas, evidence-based strategies
- **Copilot Features**: 24/7 conversational support, progress tracking, crisis management
- **Parent Training Modules**: Week-by-week curriculum with video demonstrations
