# Production ML Model Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Your Child Growth Monitoring (CGM) app is now ready for production ML model integration. This guide provides everything needed to replace placeholder models with trained, production-ready models.

## 📦 What's Been Delivered

### ✅ Core Application
- Complete Flutter app with all features implemented
- ML integration framework ready for production models
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Offline-first architecture

### ✅ Model Integration Infrastructure
- **Placeholder models** in `assets/ml_models/` with clear specifications
- **Model replacement script** in `scripts/replace_ml_models.sh`
- **Integration guide** in `ML_MODEL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Testing framework** for model validation

## 🔄 Model Replacement Process

### Step 1: Obtain Production Models

#### Option A: Train Custom Models
Use the provided training specifications:
- **MUAC Detection**: Object detection model (MobileNet-SSD/YOLO)
- **Arm-to-MUAC**: Regression model for diameter-to-circumference conversion

#### Option B: Use Pre-trained Models
Recommended sources:
- **TensorFlow Hub**: Search for "arm detection" or "body measurement" models
- **Google AutoML Vision**: Custom training with your dataset
- **Academic partnerships**: Collaborate with nutrition/ML research institutions

### Step 2: Replace Models (Quick Method)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/spr/CGM qmax"

# Run interactive replacement script
./scripts/replace_ml_models.sh
```

### Step 3: Manual Replacement (Advanced)

```bash
# Backup existing models
cp assets/ml_models/*.tflite model_backups/

# Copy production models
mv your_production_muac_detection.tflite assets/ml_models/muac_detection.tflite
mv your_production_arm_to_muac.tflite assets/ml_models/arm_to_muac.tflite

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk  # or flutter build ios
```

## 🧪 Model Validation

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
./test_execution_script.sh

# Specific ML model tests
flutter test integration_test/ml_models_test.dart
```

### Manual Validation Checklist
- [ ] Model loads without errors
- [ ] Detection accuracy >90% on test images
- [ ] MUAC measurement within ±0.5cm accuracy
- [ ] Inference time < 200ms on target devices
- [ ] Works offline without internet connection

## 📊 Model Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Detection Accuracy | >90% | mAP on validation set |
| MUAC Accuracy | ±0.5cm | Clinical comparison |
| Inference Time | <200ms | Device profiling |
| Model Size | <10MB each | File size |
| False Positive Rate | <5% | Validation testing |

## 🏥 Clinical Validation

### Recommended Validation Process
1. **Ethics approval** from relevant institutional review board
2. **Data collection** from 100+ children (6-59 months)
3. **Clinical comparison** with traditional MUAC tapes
4. **Statistical analysis** (Bland-Altman plots, correlation coefficients)
5. **Regulatory approval** (FDA, CE marking, etc.)

### Validation Dataset Requirements
- Age-stratified sampling (6-11m, 12-23m, 24-35m, 36-47m, 48-59m)
- Gender balance
- Diverse ethnic backgrounds
- Various nutritional statuses
- Different device types/cameras
