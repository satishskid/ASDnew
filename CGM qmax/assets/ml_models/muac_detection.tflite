# Placeholder for MUAC detection TensorFlow Lite model
# This file should be replaced with the actual trained model
# Model should detect arm in image and output bounding box coordinates
# Expected input: 224x224x3 RGB image (normalized 0-1)
# Expected output: [x, y, width, height] bounding box coordinates
