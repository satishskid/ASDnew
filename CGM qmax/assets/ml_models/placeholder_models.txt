# Placeholder ML Model Files

This directory contains placeholder files for the ML models. In production, these would be actual TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) models.

## Required Models:

1. height_estimation.tflite
   - Model for estimating child height from camera images
   - Input: 224x224x3 RGB image + reference object height
   - Output: Estimated height in cm

2. weight_estimation.tflite
   - Model for estimating child weight from camera images
   - Input: 224x224x3 RGB image + estimated height
   - Output: Estimated weight in kg

3. bmi_classification.tflite
   - Model for classifying nutritional status based on BMI
   - Input: [height, weight, age_in_months]
   - Output: Classification probabilities [underweight, normal, overweight]

## Training Data Requirements:

- Child images with known height/weight measurements
- WHO growth reference data
- Diverse age ranges (6-60 months)
- Various ethnic backgrounds
- Different lighting conditions and camera angles

## Model Architecture Suggestions:

1. Height Estimation:
   - CNN backbone (MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet)
   - Additional input for reference object dimensions
   - Regression head for height prediction

2. Weight Estimation:
   - Similar CNN architecture
   - Height as additional feature
   - Regression head for weight prediction

3. BMI Classification:
   - Simple feedforward network
   - 3-4 hidden layers
   - Softmax output for classification

## Note:
These models should be trained on real child growth data and validated against WHO standards. The current implementation uses fallback methods when models are not available.
